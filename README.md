# Lorebooks

This is a tool used to create, view & manage databases of worldbuilding and lore information for any given fictional canon.

I created this project because I noticed I was unable to perform effective version control on game lore. Documents lacking a singular home file became hard to manage, especially updating dependent information and references.

By using an SQLite3 database, I can organize information as formatted modules, cross referencing each other.

By using HTML generation, the database can be exported as a folder of static websites, viewable in any web browser.
